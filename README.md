# CS240 Web Programming 1

<H1>Introduction</H1>
This is my first time working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I designed 12 html pages over the course of 8 weeks, where I implement client-side programing. 


<h4>Note</h4>
I committed the homework.css file, and in the commitâ€™s description I wrote what week (unit) the commit was intended for. I apologize for the inconvenience.

<h4>Affiliation Statement</h4>
