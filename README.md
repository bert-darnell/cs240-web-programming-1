# CS240 Web Programming 1

<H1>Introduction</H1>
This is my first time working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I designed 12 html pages over the course of 8 weeks, where I implement client-side programing. 


<h4>Note</h4>
All the courses CSS is in one file (homework.css) and each change is recorded in a separate commit. I included the correct unit in the description for each commit. If examining the code, you will have to find the corresponding homework.css commit for each unit. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused."

<h4>Affiliation Statement</h4>
The course CS240 Web Programming I was provided by Park University and taught by Dr. Kathleen Kalata from August 14, 2023, to October 8, 2023.
