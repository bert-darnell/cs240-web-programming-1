		<h3>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h3>
		<p>
		Artificial Intelligence (AI) is any computer system that simulates human inteligence or the human throught process.

			<em><q>
				By the time SkyNet became self-aware it had spread into millions of computer servers all across the planet. Ordinary computers in office buildings, dorm rooms, everywhere. It was software, in cyberspace. There was no system core. It could not be shut down. --Terminator
			</q></em>

		<p>
		Movies and entertainment have been setting the tone for the dangers and expectation of AI for decades now. Movies like The Terminator and the AI entintity <q>Skynet</q> is the computer system that took over the world. But AI that is capable of world domination is far from the current capabilities, this kind of AI system is called <em>artifical general inteligence</em> or <em>artifical strong inteligence</em>. Are current capabilties are more designed to perform a specific task or a set of tasks, which is called <em>artifical narrow inteligence</em> or <em>artifical weak inteligence</em>.

		<h3>Scope</h3>
		<p>Artifical narrow inteligence has gained alot of traction in many different directions. Each of these examples below are an overview of how different AI can be implemented:

			<!-- Scope list -->
			<dt><br><strong>Machine Learning:</strong></dt>
			<dd><br>Involves training algorithms to learn from data and improve their performance over time. It includes techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</dd>

			<dt><br><strong>Deep Learning:</strong></dt>
			<dd><br>A subset of machine learning, deep learning uses artificial neural networks to model and process patterns in data. It has been particularly successful in tasks like image and speech recognition.</dd>

			<dt><br><strong>Natural Language Processing:</strong></dt>
			<dd><br>Enabling computers to understand and generate human language. It's used in applications like language translation and chatbots.</dd>

			<dt><br><strong>Computer Vision:</strong></dt>
			<dd><br>This field involves enabling machines to interpret visual information from the world. It's used in facial recognition, object detection, and self-driving cars.</dd>

			<dt><br><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong></dt>
			<dd><br>This involves training AI models to make decisions in an environment for a result. It's commonly used in training automated agents and game AI.</dd>
