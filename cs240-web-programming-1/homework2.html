		<h3>What is Machine Learning?</h3>
		<p>
		Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI, it involves training algorithms to learn from data and function autonomously. ML is what makes it possible for a system to learn from examples and not instructions. It includes techniques like supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

			<h4>Supervised Learning</h4>
			<p>
			Supervised learning is about predicting the future. This depends on if its predicting a <dfn title="classification">thing</dfn> or <dfn title="regression">number</dfn>. This is accomplished through labeled training sets. The data that is then <dfn title="samples">grouped</dfn> and tagged.

			<h4>Unsupervised Learning</h4>
			<p>
			Unsupervised learning find patterns in datasets. It also is commonly used to find the outliers of a dataset. This is done by <dfn title="clustering">grouping</dfn> data into characteristics or features.

			<h4>Reinforcement Learning</h4>
			<p>
			Reinforcement learning is about rewarding positive results and punishing negative results. This is used to train the AI to respond in manner that is optimal to the conditions.
